            User->>Frontend: Clicks on "Tech Talk" event
            Frontend->>User: Displays Event Details Page
        ```
3.  **Past Events:** A dedicated section allows you to browse through previous GDSC activities, often with photos or summaries of what happened. This is great for new members to see the club's history.
4.  **Links/Resources:** Find important external links, social media profiles, or general GDSC resources.

### Authentication

The application offers a streamlined authentication process using Firebase.

1.  **Login Button:** Look for a "Login" or "Sign In" button, usually in the header or a dedicated authentication section.
2.  **Google Sign-In:** The primary authentication method is via Google, providing a quick and familiar experience.
3.  **Anonymous Login:** For users who want to browse without a full sign-up, an anonymous login option might be available, offering limited functionality (e.g., not saving preferences).

    ```mermaid
    sequenceDiagram
        participant User
        participant Frontend
        participant FirebaseAuth

        User->>Frontend: Clicks "Login"
        Frontend->>User: Presents Login Options (e.g., "Sign in with Google", "Continue Anonymously")
        User->>Frontend: Selects "Sign in with Google"

## 6. Limitations, Known Issues & Future Roadmap

Understanding the current state and future direction of the project is crucial.

### Current Limitations

*   **API Dependency:** The application heavily relies on external APIs for event data. If these APIs are down or slow, the application's content may be affected.
*   **Static Content Management:** While some content is dynamic via APIs, certain static content (like images, descriptions not from APIs) requires code changes to update.
*   **No Offline Support (PWA limited):** Although a `manifest.json` exists, full offline capabilities (e.g., service workers for caching dynamic content) are not yet fully implemented.
*   **Administrator Dashboard:** Currently, there is no integrated admin interface for managing events, users, or content directly within the application. Changes typically require API updates or direct database manipulation for the backend.
*   **Localization:** The application is currently designed for a single language (English), without built-in localization support for other languages.

### Known Issues

*   **Carousel Autoplay sometimes stops:** In certain browser/device combinations, the `ImageCarousel` or `VideoCarousel` might occasionally pause its autoplay feature unexpectedly. A refresh typically resolves this.
*   **Initial Load Performance (Large Media):** On slower network connections, pages with numerous high-resolution images or videos might experience a slightly longer initial load time before optimizations like blur hashes fully kick in.
*   **Accessibility (ARAI Compliance):** While efforts have been made, some complex interactive components might not fully adhere to the highest WCAG/ARIA standards across all screen readers or assistive technologies. (Ongoing improvement).

### Future Roadmap

Our vision for GDSC Farmingdale Links includes:

*   **Full PWA Implementation:** Enhance offline capabilities, push notifications for upcoming events, and "Add to Home Screen" prompt for a native app-like experience.
*   **Admin Dashboard:** Develop a secure, user-friendly interface for GDSC organizers to manage events, resources, and user roles directly.
*   **User Personalization:** Allow authenticated users to save favorite events, set reminders, and receive personalized content recommendations.
*   **Advanced Filtering & Sorting:** Implement more robust filtering options (e.g., by date range, topic, speaker) and sorting capabilities for events.
*   **Community Features:** Integrate features like event comments, discussion forums, or direct messaging with event organizers.
*   **i18n (Internationalization):** Support multiple languages to cater to a diverse student body.
*   **Improved Accessibility:** Continuous auditing and improvement of accessibility features to ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance.
*   **Backend Integration for Contact Form:** Fully integrate `src/schema/contact.ts` with a functional backend service to process and store contact inquiries.
*   **Enhanced Search:** Implement fuzzy searching and faceted search capabilities.

*   **ESLint/Prettier:** Though Biome is primary, ensure you don't introduce conflicts if other tools like Prettier (`.prettierrc`) are also configured for specific file types.
*   **Meaningful Names:** Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and components.
*   **Modularity:** Keep components small, focused, and reusable.

### Testing

*   **Unit Tests:** Write unit tests using [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for critical functions and components. Place them alongside the code they test (e.g., `component.test.ts`).
*   **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** For major user flows, contribute to or create E2E tests using Vitest (refer to `vitest.e2e.config.ts`).
*   **Test Coverage:** Aim for reasonable test coverage, especially for core logic and critical UI interactions.

### Development Setup

To ensure a smooth development environment:

*   **VS Code Extensions:**
    *   Biome (for integrated formatting and linting)
    *   Tailwind CSS IntelliSense
    *   ESLint (if not fully replaced by Biome)
    *   Prettier (if still used alongside Biome)
*   **Editor Configuration:** Ensure your editor is configured to use Biome for `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, `.jsx`, and `.json` files.
*   **Pre-commit Hooks:** Consider using `husky` (if configured in `package.json`) to automatically run linting and formatting before commits.

<summary><h3>Troubleshooting Guide</h3></summary>

If you encounter issues while setting up or running the application, try these solutions.

*   **`npm install` fails:**
    *   **Node.js Version:** Ensure you are using Node.js v18.x or higher. Run `node -v`. If not, update your Node.js installation.
    *   **Cache:** Try clearing your npm cache: `npm cache clean --force` and then `npm install` again.
    *   **Network:** Check your internet connection, as dependencies are downloaded from npm registries.
    *   **Permissions:** On some systems, you might need `sudo npm install` (though generally discouraged).

*   **Application doesn't load after `npm run dev` (blank screen/errors in console):**
    *   **Environment Variables:** Double-check your `.env.local` file. Ensure all required `VITE_FIREBASE_` and `VITE_GDSC_` variables are correctly set and correspond to your Firebase project and API endpoints. Missing or incorrect values are a common cause.
    *   **Port Conflict:** Another application might be using port `5173`. Check the terminal output for messages about port conflicts. Vite usually suggests an alternative, or you can kill the conflicting process.
    *   **Compilation Errors:** Look at your browser's developer console (F12) for JavaScript errors, and your terminal where `npm run dev` is running for compilation errors. These will often pinpoint the exact problem.
    *   **Browser Cache:** Sometimes, a hard refresh (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R) can resolve issues.

*   **Mermaid diagrams not rendering on GitHub:**
    *   GitHub's Markdown renderer has specific support for Mermaid. Ensure your Mermaid code is correctly formatted within the `mermaid` block. If it's still not rendering, it might be a temporary GitHub issue or a syntax error in your diagram. Test the diagram in a Mermaid Live Editor.

*   **Authentication issues (e.g., Google sign-in not working):**
    *   **Firebase Configuration:** Verify that your Firebase project settings (API key, auth domain, etc.) in `.env.local` are correct and match your Firebase console.
    *   **Firebase Authentication Enabled:** Ensure Google Sign-In is enabled in your Firebase project's Authentication section (Sign-in method tab).
    *   **Authorized Domains:** Add `localhost` and your deployment domain to the authorized domains in your Firebase Authentication settings.

*   **"API data not loading" or "Events not showing":**
    *   **API Endpoints:** Confirm that the `VITE_GDSC_EVENTS_API_URL` and `VITE_GDSC_LINKS_API_URL` in your `.env.local` are pointing to the correct, active backend API endpoints.
    *   **Backend Status:** Check if the GDSC backend APIs are online and responsive. You might try accessing them directly via a browser or `curl` if you have their URLs.
    *   **Network Issues:** Ensure your machine has proper network access to the API endpoints.

If you've tried these steps and are still facing issues, please open an issue on our [GitHub Issue Tracker](https://github.com/GDSC-FSC/gdsc-farmingdale-links/issues) with a detailed description of the problem and the steps you've already taken.

<summary><h3>API References</h3></summary>

The GDSC Farmingdale Links frontend consumes data from several dedicated backend APIs. While the backend source code might be in a separate repository, here are the assumed endpoints and their general purpose:

*   **GDSC Events API:**
    *   **Base URL:** `[VITE_GDSC_EVENTS_API_URL]` (configured in `.env.local`)
    *   **Endpoints:**
        *   `GET /events/upcoming`: Retrieves a list of all upcoming GDSC events, including details like title, date, description, and registration links.
        *   `GET /events/past`: Retrieves a list of past GDSC events, often with summaries and possibly links to media/recap.
        *   `GET /events/:id`: Fetches detailed information for a specific event by its ID.

*   **GDSC Links API:**
    *   **Base URL:** `[VITE_GDSC_LINKS_API_URL]` (configured in `.env.local`)
    *   **Endpoints:**
        *   `GET /links`: Provides a collection of important links, such as social media profiles, official GDSC pages, or other relevant resources.

*   **Contact Form API:**
    *   **Base URL:** `[VITE_CONTACT_FORM_API_URL]` (configured in `.env.local`)
    *   **Endpoints:**
        *   `POST /contact`: Submits user contact form data (name, email, message) to a backend service for processing.

**Data Models (Illustrative Examples):**

```typescript
// Example: Event Data Structure
interface Event {
    id: string;
    title: string;
    description: string;
    date: string; // ISO 8601 format
    time: string;
    location: string;
    registrationLink?: string;
    media: {
        images?: string[]; // URLs to event images
        videos?: string[]; // URLs to event videos (e.g., YouTube embeds)
    };
    tags?: string[];
    isUpcoming: boolean;
}

// Example: Link Data Structure
interface LinkItem {
    id: string;
    title: string;
    url: string;
    icon?: string; // Icon identifier or URL
    category?: string;
}

// Example: Contact Form Submission
interface ContactFormPayload {
    name: string;
    email: string;
    subject: string;
    message: string;
