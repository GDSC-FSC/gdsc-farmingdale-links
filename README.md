## 6. Limitations, Known Issues & Future Roadmap

Every project has its constraints and areas for growth. Here's what to expect.

### Current Limitations

*   **API Dependency:** The application heavily relies on the availability and correct functioning of the external Links API and Links Links API.
*   **Client-Side Only Features:** As a frontend application, advanced server-side processing or direct database interactions are handled by the backend APIs, not within this repository.
*   **Limited Admin Functionality:** Currently, there is no integrated admin panel for content management directly within this application.
*   **Static Content (if APIs are down):** While robust, if backend APIs are entirely unreachable, dynamic content display will be affected. Fallback mechanisms are in place but may show limited data.

### Known Issues

*   **Offline Mode (Partial):** While basic offline caching for assets is supported via PWA, dynamic content requires an active internet connection to fetch the latest data.
*   **Image/Video Loading Errors:** Occasionally, external media links might fail to load due to source issues or network problems. (Handled by `Fallback.tsx` in `src/components/dom/`).

### Future Roadmap

We are continuously working to improve GDSC Farmingdale Links. Here are some planned enhancements:

*   **Enhanced PWA Capabilities:** Further development of Progressive Web App features for a more native-like experience (e.g., better offline support, notifications).
*   **User Profiles & Personalization:** Allow users to save favorite events, set reminders, or personalize their feed.
*   **Advanced Search & Filtering:** Implement more granular search options and intelligent filters for events.
*   **Integrated Feedback System:** Allow users to provide feedback directly through the application.
*   **Event Submission Form (Moderated):** Enable GDSC members to submit event proposals directly via the frontend, subject to moderation.
*   **Multilingual Support:** Support for different languages to cater to a diverse user base.
